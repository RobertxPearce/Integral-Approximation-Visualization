# Integral Approximation Visualization
Program to demonstrate the differences between Riemann Sum integral approximation methods; left endpoint, midpoint, right endpoint, and trapezoidal approximation. Using the function x^2 the user can input integration bounds to see how these methods differ in estimating the area under the curve.
